  %p Railsbridge San Diego wouldn't be possible without the help of awesome volunteers from the San Diego tech community! 

  %p Interested in volunteering? Here's how you can help:
  
  %ul
    %li
      %strong Teach a class
      &mdash; Donâ€™t worry, we provide the curriculum. If you know Ruby on Rails, you can teach at RailsBridge. 
    %li
      %strong Be a TA
      &mdash; Not sure about teaching? Well, you can be a Teaching Assistant and help students whenever they get stuck.
    %li
      %strong Setup laptops
      &mdash; Set up student laptops with everything they need for Ruby on Rails development
    %li
      %strong Not a developer?
      &mdash; There are many ways to help! You can volunteer, help organize, or even
      #{link_to "make a donation", "#about"}.
