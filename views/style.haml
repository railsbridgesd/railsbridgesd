      %h3 Sample responsive image
      
      %p To make a responsive, you should create two image files, one at @1x resolution and one at @2x resolution.
      
      %ul
        %li my_image@1x.jpg <= 128x128 pixels
        %li my_image@2x.jpg <= 256x256 pixels

      %p Then use the image_tag helper like so...

      %ul
        %li image_tag("assets/logo@1x.png", :size => "128x128")

      %p When rendered by the browser, the image will be 128 x 128 pixels in size... but browsers that support retina images will load the 2x version of the image and it will look sharper on the page.
      
      %p Note: images can be any size. Just make sure your 2x image is twice the size of the your 1x image.
      
      %p
        = image_tag("assets/logo@1x.png", :size => "128x128")

      %h3 Sample image
      
      %p
        = image_tag("assets/railsbridge.jpg", :size => "500x300")
